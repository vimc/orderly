## Workflows with `orderly`

In the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) we use `orderly` on three major projects:

- The [Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/)
- Our part of the response to the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo
- [Our part](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/) of the response to the 2019-2020 2019-nCoV-SARS/COVID-19 pandemic

The workflows we have developed here are oriented towards collaborative groups of researchers - other workflows are possible (indeed `orderly` is also designed to support a _decentralised_ workflow, though this has not been used in practice yet).

In these projects we have a group of researchers who develop and test analyses locally.  These are developed on a [branch in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging) and then run on a centralised _staging environment_ (a duplicate of our production environment).  The code and outputs are reviewed with the help of [GitHub's "Pull requests"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) and then the reports are run on our production environment.

Interaction with the remote environments is achieved using an [HTTP API](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-reporting-api) which `orderly` itself transparently uses, so that reports can be run remotely, [directly from R](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/orderly/reference/orderly_run_remote.html).  The remote systems also include an interactive web interface that can be used to explore and download versions of analyses, as well as run new ones.

## Internal database schema

`orderly` has a database, which should be the preferred way of querying the report archive from other programs.  The schema is programmatically described at [`inst/database/schema.yml`](inst/database/schema.yml) and automatically generated database documentation is available [here](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/orderly/schema/).

## Testing

There is a set of regression tests that require the reference data.  Enable these by running the script `./scripts/copy_reference` which creates data in `tests/testthat/reference`

## RStudio addins

There are [addins](https://github.com/vimc/orderly.rstudio) available to help with development workflows.

See docs at [orderly.rstudio](https://github.com/vimc/orderly.rstudio#setup) for setup and usage instructions.

## Installation

Install `orderly` from CRAN with

```r
install.packages("orderly")
```

To install our internally released version (which might be ahead of CRAN) via drat, use

```r
# install.packages("drat")
drat:::add("vimc")
install.packages("orderly")
```
