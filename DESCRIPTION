Title: Lightweight Reproducible Reporting
Version: 1.4.8
Description: Order, create and store reports from R.  By defining a
    lightweight interface around the inputs and outputs of an
    analysis, a lot of the repetitive work for reproducible research
    can be automated.  We define a simple format for organising and
    describing work that facilitates collaborative reproducible
    research and acknowledges that all analyses are run multiple
    times over their lifespans.
