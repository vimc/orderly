Orderly supports a centralised workflow, where a central server holds the canonical version of a report.  In order to make this workflow work, we need a number of things:

* To be able to run a report on a central server
* To be able to get copies of reports from the central server in order to use them as dependencies of locally run reports
* To be able to share these centrally run reports with someone

To make this workflow work, we have developed some additional software.

First, we have a docker-based server system called [OrderlyWeb](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web) which can be deployed onto a server.  We will communicate with this server over https using a package [`orderlyweb`](https://github.com/vimc/orderlyweb) which will follow `orderly` onto CRAN.

## OrderlyWeb

The OrderlyWeb server software provides a number of things

1. A persistent copy of R running `orderly` that can run reports as needed using the `orderly.server::orderly_runner` function
2. A web server that exposes a user-friendly web portal showing versions of orderly reports and an http api (this application is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org))
3. A reverse proxy used to secure the application with https

A [diagram may help show how the pieces fit together](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vimc/montagu-machine/master/docs/diagrams/OrderlyWeb%20architecture.png)

Getting OrderlyWeb installed requires a little work, and you will need access to an appropriate server running docker, our [python-based deployment tool](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web-deploy/), and TLS certificates for the server that you are using.  We recommend using [vault](https://www.vaultproject.io) for storing certificates and any secrets used in deployment.

OrderlyWeb will use GitHub for authentication, the setup for which [is described here](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web/blob/master/docs/auth.md#authenticating-with-github).

## Configuring `orderly` to talk to OrderlyWeb

Once OrderlyWeb is running, we can tell `orderly` about it by adding an appropriate setting to the `orderly_config.yml` file.  For example, if you had one testing and one production instance

```yaml
remote:
  testing:
    driver: orderlyweb::orderlyweb_remote
    args:
      host: testing.example.com
      port: 443
      token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
  production:
    driver: orderlyweb::orderlyweb_remote
    args:
      host: production.example.com
      port: 443
      token: $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

where `$GITHUB_TOKEN` is an environment variable that holds a [GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with "user" scope.  The `testing` remote is listed first, and so will be the default one used in any remote-using command.

## Interacting with the remote server

Several commands can interact with the remote server:

* `orderly1::orderly_run_remote` will run a report on a remote server, committing it immediately. This will save the log alongside the report.
* `orderly1::orderly_pull_archive` will pull a version of a report from a remote server
* `orderly1::orderly_pull_dependencies` will pull all the dependencies of a report from the remote server (i.e., versions of reports declared in the `depends:` section of a report)

## Future developments

We hope that this system will become easier to deploy in future.  We use it internally on two projects with orderly archives that hold gigabytes of analyses, and it has evolved to meet our needs.  If you think it might work for you but can't get started, please get in touch.

## Deploying a remote server

We recommend using [HashiCorp's vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for storing secrets (of which several are used here), and our tooling is designed to make this easy.

You will need to set up and/or gather a few things beforehand:

* SSL certificate and private key for the reverse proxy; in the example below we have stored the certificate in the vault
* If the orderly source repository is private, [create a deploy key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/#deploy-keys) with read-only access to your repository, and add that to the vault also
* Create an OAuth app, following instructions [here](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web/blob/master/docs/auth.md#authenticating-with-github), somewhat better instructions [here](https://github.com/ncov-ic/setup#create-an-oauth-app)
* Create a docker image that has all of your wanted R packages and external software; this image should be based off of `vimc/orderly.server:master`, for example [the Dockerfile for the coronavirus response](https://github.com/ncov-ic/ncov-orderly/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile) and push that to some accessible location (either docker hub or a private registry).  You can initially skip this step and just use `vimc/orderly.server:master` but the set of built-in packages is very limited

Create an orderly-web configuration; see [here](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid19-forecasts-orderly-web/blob/main/config/orderly-web.yml) for an example and [here](https://github.com/vimc/orderly-web-deploy/blob/master/config/complete/orderly-web.yml) for a highly annotated example.  A somewhat stripped down version of this looks like:

```yaml
vault:
  addr: https://vault.dide.ic.ac.uk:8200
  auth:
    method: github

container_prefix: orderly_web
network: orderlyweb_nw

volumes:
  orderly: orderly_volume
  proxy_logs: orderlyweb_proxy_logs
  css: orderlywebweb_css

orderly:
  image:
    repo: yourorg
    name: orderly
    tag: latest
  initial:
    source: clone
    url: git@github.com:yourorg/orderly-reports
  ssh:
    public: VAULT:secret/deploy-key:public
    private: VAULT:secret/deploy-key:private

      id: VAULT:secret/oauth/real:id
      secret: VAULT:secret/oauth/real:secret
    fine_grained: false
    montagu: false

proxy:
  enabled: true
  ssl:
    certificate: VAULT:secret/proxy/ssl_certificate:value
    key: VAULT:secret/ncov/ssl_private_key:value
  hostname: ncov.dide.ic.ac.uk
  port_http: 80
  port_https: 443
  image:
    repo: vimc
    name: orderly-web-proxy
    tag: master
```

You need to install the `orderly-web` deployment scripts from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/orderly-web/)

```
pip3 install --user orderly-web
```

With all that done, running

```
orderly-web start .
```

should bring everything up!
