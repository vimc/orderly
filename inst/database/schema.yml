          Was the requested id a specific id, rather than "latest"?

        type: BOOLEAN
        comment: >-
          Was this the latest version when run? Not necessarily the
          same as "NOT is_pinned" as a report might have been pinned
          to the most recent report when it was run.

        comment: >-
          The value is always stored as text but might represent a
          number or a boolean.  If so then we store the text
          representation of the number or boolean.  Like JSON (and R
          in the way tyhat these are being used) we don't distinguish
          between integers and floating pointe numbers, instead using
          just "number" for both.  When storing booleans, we store
          lower case "true"/"false", like in JSON, and not like R.
